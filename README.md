# Magic Music (in progress)

## Project Overview:
Magic Music is a music theory generator using python's library music21 to randomly generate music theory! This idea came to me
when I was messing around with the piano, not knowing what to warm up with. I wanted it to simulate what I had to do during
one of my piano exams where I would have to sight read a composition and be able to play it under a certain amount of time.
This project is still unfinished, but the basic idea is ready!
